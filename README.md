TriviAnimals is a website quiz game to test your knowledge on animal trivia.
This quiz game is aimed towards those who want to test themselves on animal facts. 

TriviAnimals was created by Reuben Edwards in West Sussex through GitPod.

# Features added
<hr>

### Navigation Bars
- On desktop TriviAnimals navigation bar is kept simple with the logo at the top and three links (Home, Contact and About) in the top middle of the quiz container.

- On mobile and tablet we have added a ‘Burger menu’ to adapt to smaller screens. The logo stays at the top center with our navigation menu to the right. When the navigation menu is clicked all three links appear for each section, thus, not taking over too much space.

### Landing page
- The landing page is the quiz game container with an interactive 'START' button in the center. Behind the quiz game, there is a background image of jungle trees. Alongside this, there is the navigation bar and logo.
- As this website is created solely based on the quiz game, it made sense to land you straight there, with the option of finding out more, through the about section, or contacting us, through the contact section.

### Contact
- In this section there is a contact form where viewers can input their first name, last name, email address and the question they have with a rounded ‘Send’ button following TriviAnimals color theme at the bottom.

## Features left to implement
- Difficulty levels. I am eager to implement different difficulty levels as it adds variety and more of a challenge.
- Highscore section. It would be great to add a Highscores section to add a competitive edge, for those looking to beat their (or others) highscores.
